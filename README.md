🖼️ Multiple Image Classification Using Deep Learning


📌 Project Content

This project implements a deep learning-based image classification system capable of identifying multiple classes of images. Using a convolutional neural network (CNN), the system learns patterns from input images and accurately predicts their categories. It is ideal for applications like object recognition, automated sorting, and content tagging.

 🧾 Project Code

```python
# Sample: Load model and predict
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image

model = load_model('my_model.h5')
img = image.load_img('test_image.jpg', target_size=(64, 64))
img_array = image.img_to_array(img)
img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0)
result = model.predict(img_array)

For full code, see the Jupyter Notebook or script files in the repo.

📄 Description

This image classifier accepts a dataset of images categorized into folders (one per class). The model is trained using convolutional layers followed by max pooling and dense layers. It supports multi-class classification using categorical crossentropy and a softmax activation in the final layer.

The typical architecture looks like this:

Conv2D → ReLU → MaxPooling

Conv2D → ReLU → MaxPooling
Flatten → Dense → Dropout → Output
Training history (loss/accuracy) is plotted and confusion matrices are generated to evaluate the model's performance.

🖼️ Input Type
Images are loaded from a structured folder where each subdirectory corresponds to a class label.
dataset/
├── cats/
├── dogs/
├── horses/
└── elephants/
Each folder contains relevant .jpg images. The dataset is split into training and testing using ImageDataGenerator.

✅ Output
•	🎯 Predicted class label with probability score
•	📈 Accuracy and loss curves
•	📉 Confusion matrix and classification report
•	💾 Saved model (.h5) and label encodings

Example Output:
Predicted Class: Dog
Confidence Score: 97.2%





✨ Unique Features
•	Supports any number of categories by folder naming
•	Automatically resizes and normalizes images
•	Visual output: accuracy/loss plots, confusion matrix
•	Easily extendable with transfer learning models like VGG16 or ResNet
•	Clean modular notebook design
🔮 Further Research
This project can be improved or extended with:
•	✅ Real-time classification from webcam
